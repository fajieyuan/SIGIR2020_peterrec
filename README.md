## If you want to use PeterRec in real production system. I strongly suggest: (1) understand our code released here ; (2)using TFRecord (tf.data.Dataset) and tf.estimator to replace feed_dict (slow), which is several times faster; (3) contact fajieyuan@tencent.com if you could not achieve expected results. (E.g., No personalization for new user recommendation, 99% there are bugs in your project!!)

---------------------------------------------------

PeterRec_cau_parallel.py: PeterRec with causal cnn and parallel insertion

PeterRec_cau_serial.py: PeterRec with causal cnn and serial insertion

PeterRec_cau_serial_lambdafm.py: PeterRec_cau_serial.py with lambdafm-based negative sampler 
and evaluate all items rather than sampling 100 items for evaluation.

PeterRec_noncau_parallel.py: PeterRec with noncausal cnn and parallel insertion

PeterRec_noncau_serial.py: PeterRec with causal cnn and serial insertion



NextitNet_TF_Pretrain.py: Petrained by NextItNet [0] (i.e., causal cnn)

GRec_TF_Pretrain.py: Petrained by the encoder of GRec [1] (i.e., noncausal cnn)


## Demo Steps:

You can directly run our code:

First:  python  NextitNet_TF_Pretrain_topk.py  (NextitNet_TF_Pretrain.py is slower than NextitNet_TF_Pretrain_topk.py due to the output of full softmax in the evaluation stage.)

After convergence (you can stop it once the pretrained model is saved!)

Second: python PeterRec_cau_serial.py (or  PeterRec_cau_serial_lambdafm.py)

Note that you are ABLE to use two types of evaluation methods, sampled top-N as in our paper (i.e., PeterRec_cau_serial.py) or evaluating all items (i.e., PeterRec_cau_serial_lambdafm.py). Be careful, if you use PeterRec_cau_serial_lambdafm.py, which means you are optimizing top-N metrics, then you have to evaluate prediction accuracy among all items (as shown in this file), rather than sampled metrics --- since sampled metrics are more consistent with AUC rather than true top-N. But if you use BPR or CE loss with a random negative sampler, you should use sampled metrics since the two loss with the random sampler directly optimizes AUC, rather than top-N metrics. 
I refer you to a recent papaer "On Sampled Metrics for Item Recommendation" for more details. In short, sampled metrics = AUC, rather than true top-N. BPR optimizes AUC, while lambdafm optimizes true top-N metrics (e.g., MRR@N, NDCG@N). If you use the correct evaluation methods, all insights and conclusions in our paper hold well.

or

First:  python GRec_TF_Pretrain_topk.py 
Second: python PeterRec_noncau_parallel.py

## Running our paper:
Replacing the demo dataset with our public datasets (including both pretraining and finetuning):

You will reproduce the results reported in our paper using our papar settings, including learning rate, embedding size,
dilations, batch size, etc. Note that the results reported in the paper are based on the same hyper-parameter settings for fair comparison and ablation tests. You may further finetune hyper-parameters to obtatin the best performance. For example, we use 0.001 as learning rate during finetuning, you may find 0.0001 performs better although all insights in the paper keep consistent.
In addition, there are some other improvement places, such as the negative sampling used for funetuning. For simplicity, we implement a very basic one by uniformly sampling, you can use more advanced sampler such as LambdaFM 
(LambdaFM: Learning Optimal Ranking with Factorization Machines Using Lambda Surrogates), i.e., PeterRec_cau_serial_lambdafm.py. Similarly, our pretraining network (e.g., NextitNet_TF_Pretrain.py) also employs a basic sampling function in TF, you can also replace it with your own one if you are dealing with hundreds of millions of items in a very large-scale system.

Recommendation Dataset for pretraining， transfer learning and user representation learning：
ColdRec2: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OcvbBJN0jlPTEjE0lvcDfXRkzOjepMXH
ColdRec1: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N7pMXLh8LkSYDX30-zId1pEMeNDmA7t6
    
可用于推荐系统预训练，迁移学习，跨域推荐，冷启动推荐，用户表征学习，自监督学习等任务。

```
Note that we have provided the original dataset used in the paper and several preprocessed datasets for an easy try. That is, for simplicity, we provide a source dataset along with a target dataset for each task, while in practice it is suggested to use one source dataset pretrained to serve all target tasks (make sure your source dataset covers all ID indices in the target task).


In fact, the ColdRec2 datasets has both clicking and liking actions, we have provided the following dataset, which can be used for future research by separating clicking and liking data.

### recommendation settings (Be careful!)

#### it will be much slower if 'eval_iter' is smaller as it represents how often you perform evaluation.  It may takes only 1 or 2 iterations to converge. 
Also please change the the number of batches you want to evaluate, we only show 20 batches as a demo, you can change it to 2000 maybe

        'iterations': 20, # note this is not the default setup, you should set it according to your own dataset by watching the performance in your testing set.
